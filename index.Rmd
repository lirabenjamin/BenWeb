# **Benjamin Lira Luttges**

I am a prospective graduate student that will be starting at the [University of Pennsylvania](upenn.edu) in the Fall of 2021. I will be working with Dr. Angela Duckworth.

I hope to contribute to psychological science by improving our understanding on how adversity affects self-control. Hopefully, this knowledge can be used in the future for the development of targeted interventions that help children and adolescents develop strategies to bridge the self-control gap between the rich and the poor.
